# **Privacy Policy and DNSMPI Crawler**

## **Overview**
This project is an asynchronous web scraper built with Playwright to fetch privacy policy and "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" (DNSMPI) links from websites. Additionally, it calculates the readability score of privacy policy pages using the Flesch-Kincaid grade level.

## **Required Python Modules**
1. **Python**: Install Python 3.7 or later.
2. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed to support Playwright dependencies.
3. **Playwright**: Install the Playwright library for Python.
4. **Browser Dependencies**: Playwright downloads browser binaries during installation.
