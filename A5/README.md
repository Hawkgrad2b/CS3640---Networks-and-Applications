## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, we focused on data collection, analysis, and presentation related to privacy policies and Do Not Sell My Personal Information (DNSMPI) links on websites. The tasks included:

1. **Building a Web Scraper:** Collected privacy policies and DNSMPI links from at least 100 websites in a specific category.
2. **Data Storage:** Stored the scraped data in a structured JSON format with URLs and relevant texts.
3. **Research Questions:** Framed and answered three research questions based on the collected data.
4. **Comprehensive Report:** Wrote a detailed report outlining methods, analysis, results, context, and implications.
